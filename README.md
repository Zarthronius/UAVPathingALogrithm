# UAV Pathing Algorithm
Year 2 Intelligent Systems Assignment

Uses a Genetic algorithm to map out optimal UAV pathings to a map of nodes. Nodes have assigned values and algorithm prioritises maximising quantity of nodes visited whilst remaining within required fuel capacity limits (maximum distance)
